A place that exists in the warm glow between midnight and morning. That place is The Moonlit Motel. You don’t arrive here by accident. Something in you called to it — and it answered.",
    "innkeeper": "The Motel did not begin with blueprints. It began with a person — a woman who spent years wandering the dark halls of her own mind, guiding others through theirs, learning what people needed most: a place to be soft; a place to be loud; a place to be messy and real and still welcome. So she opened a door that wasn’t supposed to exist — and the neon lights flickered awake. This was not a building. This was a home for weird, tired, heart-sore souls. She became known as The Innkeeper.",
    "soupy": "Before the Motel opened to the world, there was a test. Soupy did not arrive. He simply appeared, the way echoes appear before the sound is remembered. He wandered halls while they were still forming — doors appearing only when he tried to open them, rooms re-arranging themselves around what he needed. Glitch. Spirit. Clone. First ghost. All we know is: Soupy is the reason the Motel learned how to hold people. The Prototype Guest.",
